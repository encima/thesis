<h1>Corrections</h1>
<h2>Key</h2>
<ul>
<li>RED - Current blocker, eithe a large chunk of work or I am unsure how to progress.</li>
<li>AMBER - Requires extra work but not a significant time investment</li>
<li>GREEN - Simple modification/removal</li>
</ul>
<h2>List</h2>
<h3>Simulation experiments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[RED] Base line of WSN sending out all data to base station without DPs, i.e. a
simple mutlihop network that sends images directly out via the
shortest route and the base station does the classification. You may
want to consider the base station having MK in one scenario and
HK in another, i.e. two baselines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding in tracking of all observations shows 100% delivery (unless saturated), this needs checking</li>
<li>Flat routing has not yet been implemented, attempts to do so thus far have produced odd results.</li>
<li>Concern that nodes may be receiving in parallel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[RED] Rerun all experiments with the additional scenarios. You should report
the total number of images that were generated, the number that
arrived at the base station and the (ideally) number that were
dropped.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not so much a blocker as a large time commitment, when the above point has been addressed, these can be run 24/7</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[RED] Formalise the description of the experimental design clearly stating what variables were kept constant and which were measured. The simulation chapter needs to include (in addition to the verbal explanation) more formal software documentation of the simulation system, such as with appropriate UML diagramming methods and maybe also pseudo-code. This includes making clear how particular random generator parameters were set – i.e. where the values came from and how used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, primarily due to the number of hours it will take</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Error bars on graphs, although box and whisker plots with the mean indicated would be more appropriate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Keep figures with the text that describe them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Remove claims about energy usage in the network</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Formal design of the K-HAS</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Separate out architecture design from scenarios of its use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Make it explicit that the DA will be running on a laptop/desktop computer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] State what your architecture is capable of doing that OGC-SWE is not, particularly compared to deployments of OGC-SWE that have been used for capturing animal images</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Image classification</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Clarify role of image processing and use of templates. Bring this discussion into Chapter 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss in chapter 3 and clarify in chapter 4?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] When explaining the image processing functionality make clear the distinction between classifying an image as interesting or uninteresting and classification in the sense of determining a particular species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[RED] Make a clear statement regarding what has actually been implemented and is a part of the completed system as opposed to functionality which you have experimented but not made operational – thus explain that species classification has not been implemented in any particularly effective way in the final system, but you can explain how it would be done.
    *Again, purely based on time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] With regard to classification with templates, how would templates be matched if objects are at different angles, distance from the camera, etc?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Throughout the thesis make it clear whether functionality relies on image classification to determine a species (that has not been implemented) or identifying potentially interesting images</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Provide link to Triton source repository</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Correctly use your definition for accuracy (page 56)</p>
<ul>
<li>Update accuracy with the equations actually used? I.e. one for TP and one for TN.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Make clear that adding rules to Drools requires specialist knowledge of the drools programming language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Indicate the circumstances that could lead to a rule being added to Drools – where has the required information / knowledge come from?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[RED] The description of the architecture needs to be accompanied by software documentation diagrams or code (such as UML interaction and activity diagrams and / or pseudo-code) that makes clear the main components of the system (both software and human interventions) and how they interact with each other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ontology</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Correction of claims about ontologies in both chapter 5 and 8</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] SSN ontology is both sensor-centric and observation-centric.</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new section to include this and extension of SUMO?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Introduce SUMO as a general purpose upper ontology (with appropriate reference(s)). Then go on to state how it has been specialised for sensor network deployments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Remove claim that your ontology is modular. You reuse existing terms by importing them, but it is not modular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[RED] Need a critical discussion as to why SSN does not meet your needs</p>
<ul>
<li>Different to a tiered network?</li>
<li>Hard to show flow of knowledge?</li>
<li>Humans equal to sensors?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Definition of local knowledge</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Correct and move to appropriate part of the thesis, probably chapter 3. I would suggest removing the term global knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 3 or 4?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Fig 3.5: combine the two graphs onto a single plot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Separate out UK wet and dry and provide humidity values for the experiment (if you have them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Include the values for when DKFC loses signal</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>General comments:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] When stating that there are multiple tools, provide more than one citation</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to find these references</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Remove the acronyms ‘LK’ and ‘GK’ and replace with their expanded terms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Don’t use the term scientific observation when you specifically mean an ecological observation</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this for all uses of the term?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Remove et al from references</p>
<ul>
<li>Bibtex includes 'others' as et al, remove these from bib file</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[AMBER] Provide a map of the location of the field centre in its wider context, i.e. the part of the globe, in Chapter 1. Improve resolution of Fig 3.2 and highlight regions on picture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Remove claim at end of §3.3.1 that, based on your experiment, you can conclude that other experiments would give you the same results in the UK and Malaysia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Field names in Listing 4.3 for set.csv don’t match those given in Listing 4.4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Turn the heading ‘Findings’ in §5.1.2 into the subheading §5.1.3</p>

<li>
<p>[AMBER] 6.2 State why you are only taking 2 pictures when up until this point you have been working with 3 pictures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[GREEN] Listing 6.4 remove the setting of the scientific name as you are not sure which of the two species it is</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>

<li>p127: end of page – make clear that your explanation of rules that are based
on large amounts of collected data is hypothetical – perhaps you could
use a phrase such as “in principle ...local knowledge could be used to
make accurate classifications....” (or “the intention is that”) – the problem
here as elsewhere in thesis being that there is not a clear distinction
between what might be done, perhaps with further implementation and
deployment, and what actually has been done with your implemented
system.</li>
