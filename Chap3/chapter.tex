\chapter{Technical}
	In this chapter, we explain our motivating scenario in more detail, explore the sensor hardware that we researched and outline the results of experiments we undertook in the Malaysian rainforest. As highlighted in Section \ref{int:mot}, we have been working with Cardiff University School of Bioscience to design and deploy a WSN that utilises local knowledge, using an area of rainforest in Malaysia owned by the Sabah Wildlife Department.
